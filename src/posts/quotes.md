## Chapter 4: A Broken Economic System in a Dying Culture

### Option 1:
"Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many."  
—**Adam Smith**, *The Wealth of Nations*

### Option 2:
"True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it understands that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring."

## Chapter 5: Transforming Climate Anxiety into Purpose and Deep Hope

### Option 1:

—**Václav Havel**

### Option 2:
"When any of us feels distressing emotion, defense mechanisms come into play. But these defenses also mean we're more disconnected from reality, from feeling the energy to want to engage. So the very thing that protects us also prevents us from taking action."  
—**Climate Psychology Research**

### Option 3:
"The most important decision we make is whether we believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe."  
—**Albert Einstein**

### Option 4:

### Option 3:
"Every few hundred years in Western history there occurs a sharp transformation. Within a few short decades, society rearranges itself – its worldview; its basic values; its social and political structure; its arts; its key institutions. Fifty years later, there is a new world."  
—**Peter Drucker**
