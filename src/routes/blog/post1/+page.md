# Svelte

  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  
  _For a definition of the term "svelte", see the Wiktionary entry svelte._
  
  **Svelte** is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source) front end component framework or language created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members. Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized code that manipulates the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance. Application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified. This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate representations, such as [virtual DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOM), unlike traditional frameworks (such as React and Vue) which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.
  
  The compiler itself is written in [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript). Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.
  
  ## History
  
  The predecessor of Svelte is Ractive.js, which Rich Harris had developed earlier.
  
  Version 1 of Svelte was written in JavaScript and was released on 29 November 2016. It was basically Ractive with a compiler. The name Svelte was chosen by Rich Harris and his coworkers at _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)_.
